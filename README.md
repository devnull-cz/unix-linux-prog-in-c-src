[![Build status](https://github.com/devnull-cz/unix-linux-prog-in-c-src/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/devnull-cz/unix-linux-prog-in-c-src/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Build%22)

The files in this directory and all sub-directories are used for demonstrations
in the course of teaching "Unix programming in C" (NSWI015) at Faculty of
Mathematics and Physics of Charles University in Prague
(http://www.mff.cuni.cz/).

The course page can be accessed from https://devnull-cz.github.io/unix-linux-prog-in-c/

All the files with examples are in Public Domain, unless marked otherwise.

The source code files are kept like this on purpose:
  - not all return values are checked and reacted upon
  - some programs may present issues on purpose
  - each file is self contained (i.e. not libraries of common functions)

This is to help understand the concepts easily.
