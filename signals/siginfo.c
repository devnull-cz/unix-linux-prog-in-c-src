/*
 * POSIX.1b extension (aka POSIX.4) defines real time signals that address some
 * shortcomings of the original signals whose functionality is not changed by
 * the extension.  For those new signals, additional information is provided to
 * the signalled process.  Among that is a PID of the signalling process and its
 * UID. Example:
 *
 * $ ./a.out 		# and now kill 4114 with SIGINT ("kill -INT 4114")
 * PID 4114 started...
 * sig received: TERM
 * signalled by PID: 3764
 * and process was owned by: janp
 *
 * While the standard apparently does not define it, it seems to be possible to
 * provide additional information for "old" signals as well, if the new
 * mechanism is used.  That is what Solaris and Linux do and that is why it
 * works for SIGINT.  You can replace it with SIGRTMIN which is one of the
 * signals that the extension requires, for example, and see how it works.
 *
 * There are issues on macOS, see below.
