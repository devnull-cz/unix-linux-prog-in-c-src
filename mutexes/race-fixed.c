/*
 * From two threads, work with members of a global variable.  At every loop,
 * each thread sets both members to the value passed in by pthread_create().
 * Before the assignment it checks whether the structure members are equal.
 * If not, the thread prints its identification character.  There should be no
 * races since access to the structure is protected by a mutex.  No races means
 * there is no output.
 *
 * Compile with:
 *
 *   gcc -pthread race-fixed.c
 *
 * On system with Dtrace you can observe that threads are indeed running:
 *
 *   sudo dtrace -n \
 *       'pid$target::pthread_mutex_lock:entry { @[tid] = count(); }' \
 *       -c ./a.out
