# Use lock-unlock.c (build it and name it "lock-unlock") for file locking.
# This simple shell script simulates a single worker.  If holding a lock, it
# does some work by printing its PID.  You will see that only one process at a
# time is working.  Run it like this to see something:
#
#	$ ./run.sh xxx & ./run.sh xxx & ./run.sh xxx & ./run.sh xxx &
#
# We need bash for this script to get $RANDOM stuff. Also note that we use a
# busy waiting with "sleep 1". In production environment, that would not be
# the best way to wait.
