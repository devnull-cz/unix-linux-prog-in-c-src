/*
 * An example program to see how waitpid(3) works.  Start the program.  After
 * that, you can do 4 different things:
 *
 *   (1) wait quietly for 30 seconds to see the parent report sleep's return
 *       value which should be 0
 *   (2) kill sleep (use the child's PID printed upon startup) to see the
 *       signal number used.  Try different signals (kill <PID>, kill -9 <PID>,
 *       ...)
 *   (3) stop the child to see that the parent gets notified about that. You
 *       can stop a process by sending it a stop signal: kill -STOP <PID>.
 *       Again, use the child's PID.
 *   (4) continue the child by "kill -CONT <PID>"
 *
 * The parent will continue to report on the child states until the child is
 * finished.  Note that if the sleep is stopped it will not get the 30 seconds
 * timeout unless it gets continued again.
 *
 * Note that when the child is killed by a signal, the status word itself
 * may contain just the signal number.  However, that is just a coincidence and
 * can be implementation dependent!  Always use the WIFSIGNALED and WTERMSIG
 * macros to get the signal number.
 *
 * If WUNTRACED was not used in the flags parameter, the parent would not be
 * notified about stopped children.  Try to remove it and then "kill -STOP"
 * the child to see that.  The same stands for continuing the child - the parent
 * would not get notified about continued children unless WCONTINUED is present.
 * Also note that stopping an already stopped process is not reported, the same
 * stands for continued processes.
 *
 * See waitpid(3) for more information.
