# Demonstrate handling of environment variables.
#
# Run like this:
#
#   MYVAR="from outside" make -f Makefile06
#   MYVAR="from outside" make -f Makefile06 -e
#
# Note that that is different from setting macros as arguments of the make
# command itself.  Both invocations below will print "from make argument":
#
#   make -f Makefile06 MYVAR="from make argument"
#   make -f Makefile06 -e MYVAR="from make argument"
#

MYVAR="from inside"

all:
	@echo "defined $(MYVAR)"
