# Some make programs have directives for conditional processing of input file.
# Run like this:
#
#	make -f Makefile08.bsd
#	D=xxx make -f Makefile08.bsd
#
# NOTE: This works only with BSD make and the like (not macOS as it's shipped
# with GNU make).
#

all:
.       if defined(D)
	@echo ${D}
.       else
	@echo "D not defined"
.       endif
