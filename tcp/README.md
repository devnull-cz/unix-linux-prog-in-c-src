Bear in mind that most of the examples in this directory are written to work
with IPv4 only. This is not the way how new code should be written, it is merely
done to make the code simpler.

Any new networking code should be produced so that it works with both IPv4 and
IPv6, ideally be address-family agnostic if possible.

See the [course materials](https://github.com/devnull-cz/unix-linux-prog-in-c-labs) for more details.
