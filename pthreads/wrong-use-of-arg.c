/*
 * This example program shows incorrect use of the 1st and 4th parameters in
 * pthread_create().
 *
 * The thread data structure needs to be unique per thread, otherwise the
 * thread will become unjoinable.
 *
 * Note that the thread function uses the memory where the counter is located,
 * not the counter value as was defined on the main()'s stack.  What you are
 * going to see is implementation dependent, you can use "thread 5" messages
 * only, or some initial messages with other thread ID's before "i" gets to 5.
 * Also, try to run with any argument to see what happens.
 *
 * Compare to correct-use-of-arg.c.
