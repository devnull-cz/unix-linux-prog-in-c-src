/*
 * A very simple example on how a thread library implementation could be
 * achieved.  Remember that library threads can be used even on systems that
 * do not support threads in the kernel.  Basically, the user thread library
 * would change all blocking calls to nonblocking and if a call indicates that
 * it would block the process state is saved and one of the previously saved
 * states is used for a long jump.  Obviously, it is not trivial to write such a
 * library but this code gives you a general idea on how it could be done.
 *
 * The program saves the state and prints "0".  The first "if" is not satisfied
 * so we longjump() to the previously saved state.  "1" is then printed but
 * since "i" is 2 when the check is performed again, the program exists.  So, as
 * you can see, without any loop or a goto statement we print output twice using
 * just one fprintf() in the code.
