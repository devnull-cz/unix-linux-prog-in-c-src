/*
 * Example on writing data with select().  Use select/connect-only.c which
 * connects but does not read anything unless a 3rd parameter is provided.
 * Alternatively, you can use BSD (ie. macOS as well) netcat with -i option
 * (GNU/Linux netcat uses -i for writing only, not for reading, and is not
 * useful in this case):
 *
 *	nc -i 5 localhost 2222
 *
 * The process should stop in select() after some data has been sent over to the
 * remote side and filled up its kernel buffer for the connection there.  As the
 * client side does not read (or reads slowly), the server side eventually gets
 * a TCP window 0 (which you could see with tcpdump) after a short while as the
 * kernel buffer holding the data to be read by the client is limited in size.
 *
 * You might need to run the client from a different machine; it might not
 * behave as expected on a localhost.  System can treat that as a special case.
 *
 * To see more, use "-i 1" with netcat above, and from another terminal, trace
 * system calls (eg. use "strace -p <pid>" on Linux) performed by the server.
 * You will see that from time to time, the select() returns and the kernel
 * buffer is filled up while the netcat slowly reads the data.
